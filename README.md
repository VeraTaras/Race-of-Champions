# Mini race game

This project is implemented in C# using Windows Forms. Here you can drive your favourite car, earn money to add to your collection and complete achievements. The main thing: don't run over a pigeon!

## Features

- **User-friendly interface:** Once you open the game, you are taken to a menu from where all roads are open to you.
- **Race:** Using the arrows to move, you must bypass obstacles and collect coins. Remember: the number of lives is limited.
- **Shop:** With the money you earn, you can buy a car to suit any taste! They differ from each other in the number of lives, speed and thickness.
- **Achievements:** Completing tasks and getting achievements for them makes the game even more interesting!
